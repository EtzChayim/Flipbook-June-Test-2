Profile of a Building
Change, we all come to know, is
inevitable. So, we reshape, to adjust
to the evolving world around us.
Still, we can hold close the dearest
memories from our past, as we forge
ahead. Congregation Etz Chayim
has taken this balanced approach in
establishing new stomping-grounds
for the community at 1155 Wilkes,
infusing a modern, newly renovated
building with “a taste of Matheson,” its
former home. This balance is but one
of several reasons we have shameless
Jewish bragging rights about our
synagogue’s new building.
Touches of Matheson
Wilkes is about a third the size of the
Matheson building and approximately
four decades younger. And while
there’s no mistaking Wilkes for its North
End predecessor, there are “touches”
of Matheson throughout the new
building, helping the community stay
connected to its past. Perhaps the best
example is the magnificent stained-
glass windows which were removed
from the chapel at Matheson and have
been repurposed throughout the new
synagogue as a decorative element.
“It looks really amazing,” says Etz
Chayim President Sabrina Bokser
proudly. “The main doors from the
lobby to the sanctuary and from
the sanctuary to the social hall were
framed in a way that has all those
stained glasses as sidelights and itʼs
backlit from behind. It looks like a
million dollars.” She says they chose
a contemporary white oak to reframe
each stained-glass window. “It makes
you feel like something new happened,
but it has the taste of Matheson.” And
while photos of Wilkes were shared
with the congregation, over the winter,
as Etz Chayim’s new home was being
renovated, the stained-glass windows
detail was intentionally kept under
wraps. The surprise was revealed to the
congregation in early March once the
shul was ready to welcome community
members through its doors again.
“We wanted that ‘wow’ factor,”
says Sabrina, an architect, adding
that the stained-glass windows bring
more than beauty to the new space—
they also bring a sense of comfort.
“We brought with us the essence of
Matheson, but we repurposed it in a
more contemporary way. And I think
that will give comfort, people will see
that we brought Matheson with us.
We didn’t leave it. It’s with us and we
care. We said that we are going to keep
our roots in every way we can, and we
thought that this is a great way to do it.”
Other elements from Matheson that
moved with the congregation and
have been reintroduced into the new
synagogue on Wilkes include both arks
and the Holocaust memorial. The ark
from the small chapel was repurposed
with the same stained-glass windows
as before, “so it will look familiar, but itʼs
not exactly the same ark,” says Sabrina.
The main sanctuary ark is exactly the
same as it was on Matheson; so too
is the Holocaust memorial which has
been installed in the small chapel at
Wilkes. And if you look carefully, you
might even spot a green offshoot or
two in the shul, cut from an enormous
plant which grew for decades on the
Bimah at the Matheson building.
Environmental
Sustainability
Newer buildings are generally better
at conserving natural resources than
older ones, making Wilkes a much more
environmentally sustainable building
than Matheson was, Sabrina says.
“Compared to what we had before,
itʼs way more efficient. All the systems
and equipment are more efficient.” This
includes the building envelope as well—
all building components that separate
indoors from outdoors (exterior walls,
foundation, roof, windows and doors),
she continues.
“The building envelope is important,”
Sabrina says. “Our building was very
old. And that means the air leaked
through the windows, everywhere.
Wilkes, being a different type of
construction, means that the building
is more airtight, and we donʼt need the
same level of energy to condition (heat
or cool) the spaces.”
The size of the building also
contributes to its efficiency, Sabrina
explains. “This building is a third the size
of the previous building, considering
the basement and the main floor. We
didnʼt use most of the basement, so
in terms of energy efficiency, we were
paying to maintain and condition a
building that was not used (to its fullest
extent). It’s much more sustainable now
since the space we have is the space we
will be using—we donʼt have a surplus
of space like we had before. So that is
also more efficient.”
Wilkes is also a single-level building
with no basement, making it even
more efficient, she says. With only one
furnace, “you need more power to get
heat to the other side of the building

Chayim

and itʼs even worse when you have multiple
storeys. In this case, we only have one storey,
so the furnace and the systems work in a more
efficient way.”
Sabrina says HRV (heat recovery ventilation)
and HVac (heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning) have been replaced at Wilkes,
with modernized systems and newly installed
lighting is LED (light-emitting diode). The result
is lower operations costs and maintenance and
repair costs.
In both the short and long term, all those
factors—downsizing, reusing and repurposing
of Matheson fixtures, and increased efficiency—
contribute to 1155 Wilkes’ profile as a more
fiscally responsible building than Matheson was.
Accessibility
Wilkes is fully accessible, with not a single
step throughout the building, not even a raised
Bimah. “Everything is at ground-floor level, no
basement, no second storey, no raised Bimah; itʼs
one hundred percent accessible,” says Sabrina.
She says Etz Chayim also upgraded the audio
system at Wilkes, compared to Matheson, and
improved the acoustic insulation within the
sanctuary, both of which will result in enhanced
acoustics for the congregation. “It will be easier
to follow services in terms of acoustics, and we
have plans to improve it further, if we get some
funding.”
The front vestibule at Wilkes was renovated
to improve accessibility at the synagogue’s
entrance. “This building had a very small
vestibule, and it was difficult for people
to access the building,” Sabrina says. “We
enlarged the foyer and now it has double doors,
itʼs way more accessible, easier to navigate and
more inviting as well.”
Inclusivity
Inclusivity is a cherished value of Judaism.
It is a mitzvah to ensure that every Jew feels
they belong and have equal space within the
holy Jewish community as well as any area the
community defines as sacred. But inclusivity
goes beyond accessible architecture and
elimination of physical barriers within a space.
Even the way a space is organized can promote
inclusivity.
Etz Chayim has planned for two different
seating layouts in its main sanctuary in an
effort, again, to balance the traditional and
familiar ‘way’ with the more contemporary.
The traditional layout comprises two large
columns of chairs all pointed in the same
direction, towards the ark. The sanctuary can
also be quickly reconfigured into the second
layout, planned to facilitate praying in the
round, where participants sit in a circle or
concentric circles that arch around a central
(but not raised) Bimah. With praying in the
round, hierarchy melts away because no one is
in a position of greater importance. “Everyone
can see the same and can sing in the same
way. It’s the more inclusive approach,” Sabrina
says, adding that the audio systems at Wilkes
have also been laid out to accommodate both
seating layouts.

The Gift of Art
As you enter the Kiddush
room at Congregation
Etz Chayim, your eyes are
immediately drawn to a
stunning series of artwork
on the Northern wall of the
room. The series, “Spirit of
Jerusalem,” by Daphne
Odjig, was donated to
Congregation Etz Chayim
by Carol and Bill Beitzel,
who are active members
of the Holy Rosary Catholic
Church. At the Chanukat
Habayit dedication of the
Wilkes space in early April,
Carol explained how their
decision to donate the art
came to pass.
“I have always admired
Daphne Odjig’s work,” she
began. “When I first saw
the series, ‘The Spirit of
Jerusalem,’ I was deeply
moved. So, I bought the
series immediately.” It was
during an interfaith journey
to Israel that Carol said she
“experienced the spirit of
Jerusalem first-hand.”
“It was then I realized that
this series belongs in a
synagogue,” Carol said.
She asked that Etz Chayim
accept the gift in memory
of her family.
T h e a r t i s t , D a p h n e
Odjig, was a renowned
Indigenous Canadian
painter and printmaker.
The Jerusalem series
(1976) was commissioned
by El Al Airline, who asked
Odjig to paint Jerusalem
from her own point of view.
Winnipeg art consultant
and appraiser Sarah Secter
volunteered her time to
lovingly install the “Spirit
of Jerusalem” series at
Congregation Etz Chayim.
■
Flexibility
Allowing for two different
seating layouts means that
the Bimah, where the clergy
stand, is flexible, moveable,
and defined only by the
people within the space,
not by an elevated structure.
“Where the rabbi, the cantor,
and the Torah reader’s tables
are will change,” Sabrina
says.
This points to another
theme underpinning the
functionality of Wilkes—the
main space is designed to be
completely transformable
depending on need,
whether that be spiritual/
ritualistic or social. The ark
fits into a recessed niche in
the main sanctuary, with a
protective screen in front.
So, the space can be used
for the Shabbat service on
Saturday morning, with the
ark accessible; and then at
night, the ark can be closed
off and kept safe by the
protective screen, and the
room set up as a social hall.
All synagogue seating is on
chairs (not benches) which
can be moved and laid out
in any way desired.
“That room converts in five
minutes, from sanctuary to
social hall or bingo night or
Purim party or chocolate Seder,
whatever,” Sabrina says.
Again, this flexibility
contributes to Wilkes’
financial responsibility.
“We had a building that
was extremely large for our
needs. Once a year, it was
full for Kol Nidre, but the
rest of the year it wasnʼt and
thatʼs very hard to maintain,”
Sabrina says. Wilkes can
hold about 300 people in
its main sanctuary, which
is similar to the sanctuary
capacity at Matheson. The
social hall next to it can host
100 people for a Shabbat
Kiddush and “thatʼs what we
think probably will be used
every week,” she says.
“Of course, we might need
some extra space and we will
have to be creative,” Sabrina
continues. “But the flexible
component is very important
because the main sanctuary
will remain a sanctuary or
can be something else if we
need it to be. Thatʼs why we
donʼt have any fixed seating,”
says Sabrina, adding that
the absence of a raised and
permanent Bimah is part of
that flexibility.
Behind the offices, to
the back of the building
is a small chapel in which
about 50 people can fit.
Again, there is no fixed
seating in the chapel, which
is where Etz Chayim will
host daily minyan services
once those recommence.
“Every room is flexible and
can be something else,”
says Sabrina. She adds
that the recent pandemic
helped point the way to
new approaches in how a
synagogue could operate,
such as by offering services
remotely.
“It showed us that things
can be done in a different
way, and we have to blend
it with the old way.” Because
while change is inevitable,
we hold our past close as we
forge ahead. ■

The Memories That We Keep
Enhancing how we
remember and honour
our loved ones
At Congregation Etz Chayim’s new
home, a contemporary, more
functional digital memorial board
and system has replaced the physical
boards that once filled the memorial
lounge at 123 Matheson. “This is a really
good way forward to be able to enhance
the memories that we keep of our loved
ones,” says Kim Hirt, co-chair of the
Transition Team (with Myron Schultz).
Going digital was also the necessary
way forward with the move to Wilkes.
When Etz Chayim’s three forbear
shuls amalgamated in 2002, the new
congregation inherited more than
three shuls’ memorial boards, because
each synagogue had already inherited
memorial boards from ancestor shuls
themselves, explains Kim. Building a
memorial lounge to house some 4500 to
5000 memorial plaques was necessary
at Matheson at the time. But this had
been an expensive undertaking and
there was no room for that at Wilkes—
not physically, nor in the budget.
“So, the best way forward to maintain
that kavod (honour, respect) and
zikaron (memory) was to digitize it,”
says Kim, adding that this happened
thanks to very generous donation by
the Jewish Foundation of Manitoba.
All the plaque information had been
maintained in a database that allowed
the staff to easily identify the location
of each plaque when it was time to light
the bulb for the yahrzeit. This database
was used to create the digital entries in
the new system.
Advantages to Digitization
Digitization also means added benefits
for members, who can now more easily
search for loved ones’ memorial plaques,
access them online from home (available
to members and non-members alike via
the Congregation Etz Chayim website–
see graphic top right), and add photos
and biographical or other meaningful
details about their loved one to their
memorial.
“We have the ability to add multimedia
to a plaque’s entry, something that is
significant to them and their family,”
Kim explains. “We’ve evolved what
we can offer the congregation and
community into something that can be
more accessible and more meaningful,”
she says.
The system is set up to continuously
scroll through the list of names whose
yahrzeits are that week. Touching the
screen brings up a search tool that
allows the user to quickly look for a
loved one’s memorial plaque.
Kim says they looked into different
companies that provide infrastructure
for digital memorial boards and found
a local organization who could fulfill Etz
Chayim’s needs with a suitable backend
database and touch-screen capability.
As well, Kim explains, the system has
a Shabbat setting: the touch-screen
function is disabled from sundown
Friday through sundown Saturday,
both the monitor in the main foyer of
Etz Chayim and online, to honour the
mitzvah of abstaining from electronics
on Shabbat.
Physical Memory
In addition to the memorial plaques,
various other plaques commemorating
the memory of a loved one, a significant
event, or donation of an item (artwork,
fixtures, etc.), were affixed to walls,
pews, shelves, and fixtures throughout
123 Matheson. Those plaques were
carefully photographed by members
of the inventory committee before they
were removed. “It was an effort going
through every single room and making
sure we had everything, because we’ve
been in that building a long time and
there was a lot of physical memory in
there,” Kim says.
These plaques, too, as well as some
from the predecessor synagogues,
are accessible digitally via the “About
Us” tab on the Etz Chayim website;
dedication plaques are organized by
type (pew plaques and wall plaques)
and within each category, by floor and
location within the Matheson building.
Kim says the memorial board plaques
and most of the wall and fixture plaques
from Matheson are in safe storage and
their future disposition is still under
discussion.
She invites anyone whose family
member is memorialized with a digital
plaque at Etz Chayim to enhance it
by adding to it, if they wish. “They are
welcome to send up to three pictures in
JPEG format and text up to 250 words
to the office, to have that installed
with their loved one’s name” on their
memorial plaque, Kim says. She
encourages interested individuals to
consult other family members about
the endeavour, to make sure that there
is accord with the addition.
“This is definitely an enhancement,”
Kim says, and she hopes Congregation
Et z Chayim memb ers w ill take
advantage of it. ■

To t h e i r h o m e ’s
doorposts, a Jew
affixes a mezuzah
(plural mezuzot), a piece
of parchment inscribed
with the Torah portions
Shema and Vehayah,
two of three parts of the
prayer Shema Yisrael.
T h i s h o n o u r s a
c o m m a n d m e n t i n
the Bible: “And you
shall inscribe them
upon the doorposts
of your house and
upon your gates.”
We are directed to
inscribe, on our
doorposts, G-d’s
commandments to
love and honour
only Hashem, to
obey all G-d’s
commandments,
and to teach these
commandments
to our children
(Deuteronomy 6:4-9 and 11:13-21).
The mezuzah reminds Jews of our
covenant with G-d every time we enter or
leave a room (or home or building). It is
customary to touch the mezuzah as one
passes through the doorway, then kiss the
fingers that touched it as an expression of
one’s devotion to G-d. Some Jews also
believe that the mezuzah activates divine
protection for inhabitants of the home.
A mezuzah (which literally means
doorpost) is inscribed by a trained scribe
(sofer stam) onto a piece of parchment
on only one side. Inscribed on the back
of the parchment is only Shaddai, one
of the names for G-d. The parchment is
then rolled into a scroll (klaf) from left
to right; if rolled correctly “Shaddai” will
face the front of the mezuzah. The klaf is
enclosed in a case and while these tend
to be ornately or artistically decorated,
there are no stipulations for how the
case should look, what it is made of, or its
shape and size. The case is not sealed so
that it can be opened, twice every seven
years, and the parchment examined for
fading or other damage.
The Halakha of Mezuzot
Halakha (Jewish law) prescribes that
we affix mezuzot not only to the exterior
doorposts of our homes but also every
doorpost inside our homes (non-living
spaces like bathrooms, closets, and
laundry rooms are excluded). We are also
guided to hang the mezuzah to the right
side of the door as one enters the room,
at the lower part of the top third of the
doorpost. Among Ashkenazic Jews it is
customary to hang the mezuzah at a slight
angle, with the top end pointing into the
room and the bottom pointing outward.
Sephardic Jews hang the mezuzah
vertically. There is also Halakha related
to hanging mezuzot in a new home. If
the home has been purchased, whether
in Israel or the Diaspora, we are taught
to install mezuzot as soon as we sleep
under its roof. For a rental in the Diaspora,
we have 30 days to hang mezuzot after
moving in, but in Israel, the obligation to
install mezuzot remains immediate, just
as if the home were purchased.
When moving out of a home or
building, a Jew should not remove the
mezuzot if it is known that another Jew
will be moving in. “You would leave the
mezuzot for them,” says Steven Hyman,
ritual committee chair for Etz Chayim.
Because an Eritrean church community
purchased the Matheson building, “we
were under no obligation to leave the
mezuzot,” he continues.
Mezuzot at Etz Chayim
When Congregation Etz Chayim
moved into its new home on Wilkes,
two mezuzot from Matheson were
installed in preparation to receive the
congregation for the first Shabbat service
in its new home in early March—one on
the main entrance doorway, and one on
the entrance to the sanctuary. A simple
Hebrew blessing was said before nailing
the mezuzah to the doorpost: “Blessed are
You, God, Ruler of the universe, who has
sanctified us with commandments and
commanded us to affix a mezuzah.” This
happened more than a month before the
official dedication of the Wilkes building
as a place of worship for Congregation Etz
Chayim.
“We thought it was more important to
get people into the space to daven (pray).
The balance struck was to place mezuzot
and say the blessing for the space that we
were going to be using as the worship space
in advance of dedicating the building,”
says Steven. The community was later
invited to take part in the joy of installing
a mezuzah during the official dedication
of Congregation Etz Chayim’s new home
at the Chanukat Habayit celebration in
early April. By installing this mezuzah and
the others on its doorposts, Congregation
Etz Chayim has committed to following
all G-d’s commandments, to love and
honour only Hashem, and to teach G-d’s
commandments to our children. ■

PEOPLE Honouring the Mitzvah of Installing Mezuzot
Etz Chayim Members Share Heartwarming Details About Mezuzot in Their Lives
We have always shared a
special intimate ceremony
when affixing our mezuzot
in a new house. We make
sure our scrolls are good
(Chabad Winnipeg checked
them last time we moved),
we recite the blessings, kiss
the mezuzot, and then get
that blessed feeling that our
family is protected in the
new home.
— Val Benevet
Reclaiming the Mitzvah
of Hanging a Mezuzah
I remember putting a Mezuzah on the doorpost of my
first apartment when I moved out at 18, a ceramic mezuzah
I’d gotten for my Bat Mitzvah. I didnʼt recall who had given
it to me, and still I had always kept it in a special place for
“one day.” That is the only time I placed a mezuzah in the
doorway of my home. I remember it offered a familiar sense
of comfort in my first home away from home, as my parents
have always had a mezuzah by the door at their house.
As I got used to being on my own, my need for those
familiar touches and comforts faded. I didnʼt really think
about having a mezuzah again, until very recently. I have
newly been revisiting many of the Jewish customs and
family traditions from my childhood that I have let slip away
in my lifetime. Since October 7th, I have been feeling a deep
sense of curiosity about the sacred symbols, objects, and
tools that we embrace in our Jewish lives and living. I love
the ceremonial and ritualistic aspects of our culture and
faith, and my curiosity has led me to a newfound love and
respect for what it means to be Jewish in every way.
I will never forget seeing a post on Facebook just days
before Halloween that suggested Jews remove their
mezuzot from their doorways for safety, if they planned to
welcome trick-or-treaters. I was filled with a mix of emotions.
I immediately felt sadness, fear, anger, and tension take hold
of me. My initial reaction was to agree that we need to be
safe and protect ourselves first.
Something changed over the coming days. I watched
as Jewish university students stood up to the same hatred
and intimidation that had me in hiding. I saw my younger
cousins each donning their Magen David with a deep sense
of Jewish pride, and I began to notice more and more of
my friends, family, and colleagues wearing IDF-inspired
dog-tags for the hostages, blue ribbons, numbers written
on tape worn to mark the number of days that the hostages
have been held in captivity, and countless other examples
of people standing up boldly in support of Israel and Jews
everywhere. The more I looked for them, the more inspiring
examples I found.
Fast forward to March 1st, 2024. In preparation for our
first Shabbat morning service at 1155 Wilkes, the Rabbi,
Cantor, and members of the staff stood in the doorway of
our new synagogue and spiritual home to hang a mezuzah
in preparation of welcoming others to pray. This was entirely
informal and yet deeply meaningful. The Rabbi said a few
words and blessed this space that we now call home. That
evening, I knew that I am ready to reclaim the tradition and
mitzvah of hanging a mezuzah on the doorpost of my home.
I am looking forward to the Womenʼs League opening their
shop in hopes of finding a perfect piece to hang.

Kevin
McIntyre
Primary Torah
Reader
A s p r i m a r y
Torah reader for
C o n g r e g a t i o n
Etz Chayim, part
of Kevin McIntyre’s role is to read or
lein Torah on Shabbat and the festival
holidays – Sukkot, Shavuot, and Pesach.
When Etz Chayim returns to weekday
services in person, Kevin will also read
Torah on Mondays and Thursdays. He
says he’s grateful for the opportunity to
use the ancient arts of Torah trope and
cantillation, which tells the musical motif
of the parasha (Torah portion) each week.
“I feel so blessed to be part of this ancient
practice,” Kevin says.
A large part of Kevin’s role is recruiting
community members to participate
in services by reading Torah. “It’s such
a blessing to participate in a reading,
whether that’s the entire portion or just
a verse or two,” he says. Kevin is there to
teach interested congregants how to read
Torah or support them as they learn their
parasha He says he’s already heard from
several interested Etz Chayim members
and “we’re absolutely thrilled that people
want to participate.”
Kevin believes his background as a
musical theatre performer helped him
move more confidently into this new role
as Torah reader. “It’s a huge undertaking
to do this every week,” he says. “So my
chutzpah as a performer helped.”
In his third year as a cantorial student,
Kevin says the opportunity to actively
participate in services (as Torah reader
or occasionally, to help lead services
when Cantor Tracy has been away) has
enriched his learning. “It’s been extremely
helpful as a student to use the skills you’re
learning in real time.” He encourages
anyone interested in learning to read
Torah or preparing a Torah portion for an
upcoming service to contact him by email
or by calling the Etz Chayim office.

Family
New
Members
Jose Navarro
says his close-
k n i t f a m i l y
consists of five
members: Jose
and Monica have two children – Joss, a
University of Manitoba student, and Ana,
a grade 11 student at Gray Academy. The
family dog, the “lovely Luna” is the fifth
member of the family.
The Navarros emigrated from Mexico
City to Winnipeg close to two years ago.
Some good friends introduced them
to Congregation Etz Chayim, inviting
the family to join the community for a
couple of Shabbats. “We immediately
connected with the congregation; we
found many nice and friendly people,”
says Jose, adding that his family enjoys
celebrating the Jewish holidays. Jose
says his family also loved how religious
services were conducted at Etz Chayim,
they found the president to be warm and
welcoming, and they enjoyed listening
to Cantor Tracy sing, to the Divrei Torah
being recited, and to Rabbi Kliel’s good
sense of humour. After joining the
congregation as guests during the High
Holidays, “we knew we wanted to be part
of the Etz Chayim family,” says Jose, who
has a personal passion for researching
and studying Jewish history. ■]]></page><page Index="9" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[JUNE 2024 | סיון תשפ״ד | SHORESH 9
Dedicating
Our New Home
On a sunny day in early April,
the Congregation Etz Chayim
community gathered at 1155
Wilkes to consecrate their new home
as a place to come together as Jews, to
pray, and to find meaning in Jewish life.
The Chanukat Habayit ceremony began
outside with a public affixing of a mezuzah
to the exterior door of the shul. The Sifrei
Torah were then carried in a processional
into the building and eventually placed
inside the ark, serenaded by Kevin
McIntyre (on bagpipes), Myron Schultz
(on clarinet), and his brother Victor
Schultz (on violin) with a medley of
festive Jewish music as others danced.
The celebration continued with a video
presentation of the Congregation Etz
Chayim Memories Project, some speeches
and prayers, and some refreshments, to
celebrate the dedication of Wilkes as a
sacred space.]]></page><page Index="10" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[סיון תשפ״ד | 2024 SHORESH | JUNE 10
USY in Full Swing
Again
USYis off to a fantastic start as
Congregation Etz Chayim
rounds up its inaugural year of the
United Synagogue Youth group revival.
While USY programming this year was
focused mainly on youth in grades 5
through 8, in April, Etz Chayim also
began to offer programming for kids
in grades 9 through 12. USY advisor
Natan Skladnik says the shul hosted
a USY event every month beginning
November 2023, and he offers
highlights from his favourites:
“One of our best was The Golf Dome,
where we went to play mini golf,”
he says. That was followed by some
icebreaker games and getting to know
each other, because it was the first
program of the year, he explains. “Then
we had a discussion on what it means to
be Jewish and on the value of Israel,” he
continues. “Everybody seemed really
engaged and it was nice for them to be
able to give their opinions.”
Another favourite program was a
serendipitously scheduled January
“Skating Olympics” (during that one
week of the winter it was actually cold
enough to skate) at the Linden Woods
Community Centre. “People came up
with a character and a country and a
silly name and they would compete
through silly ice-skating competitions.
It was fun, a really good time,” says
Natan.
Later, the group returned inside for a
discussion about Tu Bishvat, which was
approaching then. “We talked about
what Tu Bishvat is, why we celebrate
it, the historical, cultural, and modern
meaning.” This was followed by a
“Shark Tank”-style activity—each group
of participants came up with a product
or idea “and made a little shtick and
pitch for it,” he says.
In February the group went to Fort
Whyte for a fun day of orienteering and
sledding. Then, because Valentine’s Day
was around the corner, a connection to
Tu B’Av was made for discussion. While
this minor Jewish holiday has origins
in the bible (as a day of celebration
denoting the beginning of the grape
harvest), among contemporary secular
Jews the holiday is acknowledged as
a holiday of love (and often a favourite
day for Jewish weddings). The holiday
actually lands in the summer (often
in the month of August). But “I said,
it doesn’t really matter. People will
be happy to learn that Tu B’Av exists,”
Natan says.
In April, a USY program to visit Fun
Park Amusement Center (located
next door to Etz Chayim) was a huge
success. Seventy-one Jewish youth
attended the event to play master tag
and enjoy bouncers, rock climbing, a
foam pit, and a play structure. Later,
the group returned to the shul for pizza
and refreshments, a visit with Rabbi
Kliel, and a hand-painting activity to
create artwork to decorate the USY
room at Etz Chayim. “Everyone was
quite happy with the program and how
it went,” Natan says.
“We’re not used to so many kids
but it’s a good problem to have,” he
continues. “It was awesome to see so
many kids in the shul.”
Natan did have some extra help that
day. Before the event, he had met with
six high school-aged teens, all of whom
were interested in joining USY. After
a discussion about the synagogue
youth group and a quick Torah-study,
the teens volunteered at the Gesher
(middle school) Fun Park program.
“They were essential in its success,”
Natan says.
At time of writing, Natan was excited
about upcoming programming,
including a May, all-ages Lag Ba’omer
event of axe throwing, archery,
bouncers, carnival games, crafts,
and team games, and the launch of
“Tikkun Olam Days” at the end of May,
a monthly gathering opportunity for
youth to volunteer for an important
cause.
Natan says that the numbers
attending USY events seem to
depend on the program, but the
most important thing is that the youth
keep coming back. “I’ve been very
happy with the way we’ve established
ourselves. Our programs have been
consistent and now, we’ve really
established a solid group of people
who come and who engage and who
are into it. I’m happy to see it,” Natan
says. ■]]></page><page Index="11" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[JUNE 2024 | סיון תשפ״ד | SHORESH 11

Dreaming Big
Last December, one Etz Chayim
youth had opportunity to participate
in a powerful event focused on the
future of Conservative Judaism.
Daniel Bokser, a grade 11 student
at Gray Academy, was nominated
by Congregation Etz Chayim to
represent the synagogue at an
international USY Teen Shabbaton in
Baltimore, MD. This was part of a larger
Conservative/Masorti Shabbaton
and Convening, which brought
together representatives (of all ages)
from hundreds of synagogues and
organizations to “dream big” about
the future of the Conservative/Masorti
movement.
Daniel says participants at the
Shabbaton were motivated by shared
goals. “Everyone was there because
they genuinely care about Judaism or
because they want to be better Jews
themselves. All the kids were very
enthusiastic and always tapping into
that spiritual side. There was lots of
meaning behind every program and
lots of song and prayer,” he says.
The weekend offered USY
participants an abundance of options
and opportunities to learn, daven (pray),
and participate in discussion about
critical topics for Conservative Jews.
Daniel says one of the most memorable
events during the Shabbaton, for him,
was a community Havdalah, for which
the USY participants gathered with the
rest of the assembly.
“It was probably six, seven hundred
people all in one room and it was so
powerful to hear so many people with
so much emotion. And the underlying
message that was being spread was
that we, the Jewish people, the Israeli
people, we’re still here. After October
7th, it was really powerful to see so
many people together, congregating
for something that we all believe. Every
single person in that room shared
something,” he says.
He describes a spiritual energy that
was palpable. “I bet every person could
feel the power behind every lyric, could
feel the intensity behind the song itself.
It was as if every person really dug deep
into the lyrics and took out the meaning
of Judaism or their spirituality and
applied it in that moment. That was the
best experience that weekend,” he says.
Daniel came away from the
Shabbaton with many new friends
and contacts, a “spiked” interest in
tefilla (prayer) and a new toolbox for
potential future USY programming or
conventions back at home.
But there was something more
profound that he gained from the
experience, too.
“I want to emphasize just how
powerful it was to know that every
person on my left, right, and in
front and behind me, we all shared
something,” he begins. “We all cared
about the future of Conservative
Judaism, and we made it a goal within
ourselves to share that with each
other and with our communities when
we came back home. That was the
beauty of that convention. And now,
it’s my responsibility to teach what Iʼve
learned. I think that USY is somewhere
I can apply that knowledge, especially
through teens like myself.” ■]]></page><page Index="12" isMAC="true"><![CDATA[ס׳ון תשפ״ד | 2024 SHORESH | JUNE 12]]></page></pages></Search>
